This repository contains C++ program on function overloading 

Function overloading in C++ is a feature that allows you to define multiple functions with the same name but different parameters. Here are the key points about function overloading in C++:

**Multiple Functions:** You can define multiple functions in the same scope with the same name.

**Different Parameters:** These functions must have different parameter lists, which can vary in terms of the number, type, or order of parameters.

**Compile-Time Resolution:** The appropriate function to call is determined at compile time based on the number and types of arguments provided when the function is called.

**Return Type Doesn't Matter:** The return type of the overloaded functions doesn't play a role in differentiating them. Only the function name and its parameters matter.

**Use Cases:** Function overloading is useful when you want to provide multiple versions of a function that perform similar tasks but with different types of data or different numbers of arguments.
